How to use this asset:
Asset is ready to use out of the box just apply material you want to a mesh that should be water in your scene!
You have a lot of parameters to modify in each material so you can achieve the effect you want by just changing couple values.
If you are creating your own water shader you can use modules from my materials to achieve your goal faster f.e. you can use CalculateFoam Sub Graph
to calculte foam for your water with just couple nodes in graph editor.
