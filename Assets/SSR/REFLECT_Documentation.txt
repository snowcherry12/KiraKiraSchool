==-------------------------= Setup =-------------------------==

- On your URP Renderer Asset set the Rendering Path to Deferred.
- On your URP Renderer Asset disable "Accurate G-buffer Normals".
- On your URP Renderer Asset add the "Reflect Render Pass" renderer feature.

- On any Volume in your scene, select "Add Override" and choose "GapperGames/Screen Space Reflections".

- Setup Complete :)

How to locate URP Settings/Renderer Asset:
1. Go to Edit/Project Settings/Graphics and select the 'Scriptable Render Pipeline 
Settings'. This is your URP Settings Asset
2. From your URP Settings Asset, select the first item in the 'Renderer List'. This is 
your URP Renderer Asset

==-----------------------------= Reflection Settings =----------------------------==


	Downsample - The resolution that the reflections render at relative to the size of the screen.

	Steps - The amount of steps used to calculate reflections.
	
	Step Size - The size of steps used to calculate reflections.
	
	Thickness - The threshold that the algorithm uses to determine an intersection.

	Samples - The samples used at an intersection point to find the reflection.

	Min Smoothness - The minimum smoothness that the reflections will be rendered above.

	=---= To access the reflections in a shader, the reflections tex is a global texture called: "_ScreenSpaceRelfectionsTex".

==-----------------------------= Transparent Reflections =----------------------------==


	To achieve transparent reflections, first create a new material with the shader: "GapperGames/SSR_Transparent".
	The material behaves the same as a standard transparent material, except it will receive SSR.
